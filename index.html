  <h1>We manage school sports participation — end to end.</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Schools want their students to compete. Participation fails when operations fail.
    We ensure your school shows up — reliably, compliantly and on time. We manage
    registrations, documentation, logistics and match-day execution so your staff
    can focus on students.
